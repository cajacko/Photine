## Running Photine
Photine is not currently in production, so you need to run the dev environment to play with it.

Download this repo. Copy ~/.env-sample to ~/.env and change the express port details if you need to.

Install all dependencies with yarn:
```
yarn
```
Run the express app and webpack in watch mode with:
```
yarn start
```
You can now visit the site at http://localhost:3005 or whichever port you specified
